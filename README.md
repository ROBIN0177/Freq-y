# Freq-y
## Your Frequency Scanning Companion

I made this project because there isn't a cheap frequency scanner you can rely on. If you've built RF projects before, you know the pain of tracking down a signal leak, figuring out where it's coming from, what frequency it's on, and which device is causing it.

I ran into this myself: my home WiFi was getting choked by an unknown source. Turned out to be my own custom radio bleeding into the band. This scanner also lets you test how much shielding a material actually provides—whether it's a wall, a case, or a Faraday cage. Pinpoint the exact device causing interference easily. (Unlike me. Took 3 days to figure out..)

(Mind the hole, it's for a rocker switch I couldn't get a STL of.)
